#  __Project__ ðŸš§
One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. For example, a user might be in San Francisco's Financial District whereas Uber drivers are looking for customers in Castro.

(If you are not familiar with the bay area, check out Google Maps)

Eventhough both neighborhood are not that far away, users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride.
Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day.

----------------

# __Goals__ ðŸŽ¯

Uber already has data about pickups in major cities. Your objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. Therefore you will:
* Create an algorithm to find hot zones
* Visualize results on a nice dashboard

----------------

# __Deliverables__ ðŸ—ƒ

A notebook with:
* visualisations
* captions and interpretations 
* A map with hot-zones described per day of week
* Results compared between two unsupervised algorithms: KMeans and DBScan
